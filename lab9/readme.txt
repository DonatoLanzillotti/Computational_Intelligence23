The ideas have been discussed with Triet Ngo (s309062)
The strategy can be summarized as follows:
- The tournament wheel has been used for the parents selection
- For the offsprings generation has been done by using one-point crossover/uniform crossover followed by mutation 
- The mutation rate is updated during the iterations, if there is no improvement. In particular, higher value in order to promote exploration.
